Scripts:

getvisitors.py - Gets the current visitor number from visitors.txt and returns it
updatevisitors.py - Gets the current visitor number from visitors.txt, increases it by 1, and the overwrites visitors.txt

php scripts in index.php -
Display location: I used a geolocation API that I found online for this. After downloading the API php file and getting an API key, I was able to get the location of the visitor through this method.

Display OS-Browser: not really a script, just a command I found for PHP
Display current time: again, not really a script, just a command that I found

Extra Credit: I have implemented 3 additional features instead of the required 1 additional feature on top of displaying the visitor number.
